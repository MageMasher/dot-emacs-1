# grzm's Emacs configuration
-----

This is my dot-emacs. There are many like it, but this one
is mine. My dot-emacs is my best friend. It is my life. I must master
it as I master my life. My dot-emacs, without me, is useless. Without
my dot-emacs, I am useless.

## Requirements

The configuration requires `use-package`.

I generally use this configuration with [Emacs for Mac OS X](https://emacsformacosx.com)
