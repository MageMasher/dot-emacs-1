grzm's Emacs configuration
==========================

This is my dot-emacs. There are many like it, but this one
is mine. My dot-emacs is my best friend. It is my life. I must master
it as I master my life. My dot-emacs, without me, is useless. Without
my dot-emacs, I am useless.

Requirements
------------
The configuration requires ELPA, as well as some packages installed
via ELPA, including:

* paredit
* clojure-mode
* slime

I generally use this configuration with Aquamacs.
